Find the Center Mark on the Free Throw Line
</h2>



<p>
You should place your dominant hand, side foot in a perpendicular alignment with the center mark of the free throw line.  Your other foot should be shoulder width apart and parallel to your dominant hand side foot.  Your non-dominant hand side foot should be placed a few inches back from your dominant hand side foot. This is putting your body in the correct alignment to take the shot.
